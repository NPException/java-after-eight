Baseline @ REPL:

   Java - avg: 48 ms
Clojure - avg: 400 ms
(Note: pretty-printing to EDN format is damn expensive; the avg goes up to 716 ms in that case)



> parallelize article parsing
Clojure - avg: 336 ms

> parallelize infer-typed-relations
Clojure - avg: 199 ms

> use transient map in aggregate-typed-relations
Clojure - avg: 195 ms

> use records for more efficient field access
Clojure - avg: 137 ms

> use Java's Files/readAllLines to ingest article files (drawback: `parse-article-from-file` is now limited to File instances)
Clojure - avg: 128 ms

> use 'group-by' with 'juxt' to make the code much more clear (but sacrifice a few milliseconds for it)
Clojure - avg: 136 ms

> run from fully AOT compiled uberjar
Clojure - avg: 122 ms

==> execute uberjar from commandline
~1530ms


Took me way too long to realize: I had the silly genealogist active in my clojure runs...
> only use tag genealogist like the java version does
Clojure - avg: 74 ms
